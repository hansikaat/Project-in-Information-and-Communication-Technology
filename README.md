## About us
Team Transmission is a goup of 6 ICT students at KTH in Stockholm and we're doing this project is a part of the course *Il1305 Project in information and communication technology*. The idea came from a team member's brother who is a frequent hunter and felt like this app has been missing from the market. We're excited about taking on this challenge and learn more about team work and app development!
